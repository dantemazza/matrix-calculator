# matrix-plus

## matrix_calculator2 (GUI):
Calculates the determinant, adjugate and inverse of n x n real matrices. The program implements the Laplace/cofactor expansion algorithm for finding determinants recursively and completes operations on square matrices of up to order 8 instantly. Laplace expansion is infeasible for larger matrices, but is effective for the portable, small-scale use that this calculator provides. 


## matrix_calculator3 (console):
In addition to the features of version 2: implements QR Decomposition (Q generated using Gram-Schmidt) and its iterative eigenvalue algorithm to converge on the semi-diagonal Schur form of a Matrix A. Iterates through the resulting matrix to return real and complex eigenvalues located from its main diagonal and subdiagonal 2x2 blocks. 

Made using previous knowledge of linear algebra (MATH115) and independently learned concepts.
